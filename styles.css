/* Static and Relative Positioning

    1. static is the default positioning that follows the flow of the HTML document, it is unaffected by top, right, bottom, and left CSS properties
    2. relative is identical to static in positioning, however it can be affected with top, right, bottom, and left CSS properties
    3. When "position: relative" is applied the element is now outside the normal document flow and will not affect the elements around it
    4. relative is rarely used for position as a result of not affecting things around it

.parent {
  border: 1px solid black;

/* Absolute Positioning

    1. relative positioning allows you to position something at an exact point on the screen without disturbing any other element
    2. "position: absolute" is affected by the top, right, bottom, and left CSS properties
    3. Examples of use cases include: modals, image with captions on it, and icons on top of other elements
    4. For an absolute positioned element to stay inside another, the parent must have position relative
